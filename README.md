# Notes
*A series of notes on the various courses offered by the Politecnico di Milano regarding Computer Science.*  
The notes are taken in markdown.  
I suggest you to download a markdown editor like Typora to better visualize the structure of the notes and especially to be able to see the math equations.  
In Typora you should activate the Math Inline option. To do so go to file -> settings -> markdown -> syntax support.
